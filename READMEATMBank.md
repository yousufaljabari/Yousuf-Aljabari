This small project is an ATM machine
where a set of operations are performed, namely: 
 1- A quick withdrawal, and the amounts are: 
{
1 - 20
2-50
3- 100
4- 200 
5- 400
6- 600 
7- 800
8 - 1000
9- Exit the withdrawal screen
}
2- Normal withdrawal provided that the number entered is a multiple of 5
3- Deposit
4-Checking the balance
5-Logout
I used a combination of the previous method that was used in the previous two projects with minor modifications ..
